# NFT Shop

Welcome to the NFT Shop! This project is an e-commerce shop for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT's). For the newcomers to the space, a Non-Fungible Token is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files.

## About the Project

This application allows users to select and purchase NFT cards that are redeemable to attend NFTCon, an annual super conference only accessible to original card holders. All NFT collectibles are encrypted and secure in the Ethereum blockchain. Thus, all cards must be purchased in ETH currency. There are four collectible categories: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Each category represents how scarce a card is, thus a holder of a more uncommon card will have extra benefits at the conference.

## Technologies

This project was built with the technologies listed below:

- ReactJS
- HTML/CSS
- Firebase
- React-Bootstrap

The motivation to use these technologies was simplicity, efficacy, and performance. ReactJS is a widely adopted front-end framework known for allowing breathtaking performance while maintaining the code clean and reusable. In addition, Firebase was used as the Backend service due to its simplicity and ease of integration. Finally, React-Bootstrap was the preferred library for overall styling and structuring due to its responsiveness and practical use. 


## Next Steps

As of now, the cart section in this application is currently a mock, so users cannot purchase items. Later in the future, the goal is to integrate a fully-functional cart payments system by adopting Stripe. 

## Technical Details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
